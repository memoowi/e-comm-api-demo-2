A historian whose arguments operate on the scale of millennia has managed to capture the zeitgeist perfectly.‚Äù‚ÄîThe Economist\n\n‚ÄúThis deeply important book comes at a critical time as we all think through the implications of AI and automated content production. . . . Masterful and provocative.‚Äù‚ÄîMustafa Suleyman, author of The Coming Wave\n\nFor the last 100,000 years, we Sapiens have accumulated enormous power. But despite allour discoveries, inventions, and conquests, we now find ourselves in an existential crisis. The world is on the verge of ecological collapse. Misinformation abounds. And we are rushing headlong into the age of AI‚Äîa new information network that threatens to annihilate us. For all that we have accomplished, why are we so self-destructive?\n\nNexus looks through the long lens of human history to consider how the flow of information has shaped us, and our world. Taking us from the Stone Age, through the canonization of the Bible, early modern witch-hunts, Stalinism, Nazism, and the resurgence of populism today, Yuval Noah Harari asks us to consider the complex relationship between information and truth, bureaucracy and mythology, wisdom and power. He explores how different societies and political systems throughout history have wielded information to achieve their goals, for good and ill. And he addresses the urgent choices we face as non-human intelligence threatens our very existence.\n \nInformation is not the raw material of truth; neither is it a mere weapon. Nexus explores the hopeful middle ground between these extremes, and in doing so, rediscovers our shared humanity.', '[]', 48000, 4363, 4.0, 30, '[\"uploads\\\\product\\\\1738207847669-954907179.jpg\"]', '2025-01-30 03:30:47', '2025-02-05 09:01:36'),

Join a young CIA officer as he recruits a reluctant foreign agent. And sit with an accomplished surgeon as he tries, and fails, to convince yet another cancer patient to opt for the less risky course of treatment. In Supercommunicators, Charles Duhigg blends deep research and his trademark storytelling skills to show how we can all learn to identify and leverage the hidden layers that lurk beneath every conversation.\n\nCommunication is a superpower and the best communicators understand that whenever we speak, we‚Äôre actually participating in one of three conversations: practical (What‚Äôs this really about?), emotional (How do we feel?), and social (Who are we?). If you don‚Äôt know what kind of conversation you‚Äôre having, you‚Äôre unlikely to connect. \n\nSupercommunicators know the importance of recognizing‚Äîand then matching‚Äîeach kind of conversation, and how to hear the complex emotions, subtle negotiations, and deeply held beliefs that color so much of what we say and how we listen. Our experiences, our values, our emotional lives‚Äîand how we see ourselves, and others‚Äîshape every discussion, from who will pick up the kids to how we want to be treated at work. In this book, you will learn why some people are able to make themselves heard, and to hear others, so clearly.\n\nWith his storytelling that takes us from the writers‚Äô room of The Big Bang Theory to the couches of leading marriage counselors, Duhigg shows readers how to recognize these three conversations‚Äîand teaches us the tips and skills we need to navigate them more successfully.\n\nIn the end, he delivers a simple but powerful lesson: With the right tools, we can connect with anyone.', '[]', 242000, 2352, 4.4, 30, '[\"uploads\\\\product\\\\1738207914219-736164538.jpg\"]', '2025-01-30 03:31:54', '2025-02-05 09:08:53'),
